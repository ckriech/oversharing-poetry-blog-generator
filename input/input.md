This is where all of your soul-searching, personal, I-don't-ever-want-anyone-to-read-this journal entries go.

Actually you can put whatever you want here, it's just THEMATICALLY CONSISTENT to use your journals. 

Simple text files are best, although there's a script in `PUT LOCATION HERE` that can extract from evernote exports (.ENEX)*


*If the poetry made with extracted notes from .ENEX files comes out with contractions like `can t` instead of `can't`, I probably forgot to fix the issue where .ENEX files uses the character `â€™` (U+2019) for apostrophe instead of `'` (U+0027), a quick replace-all will fix that.
