 Your eyes give you sight, your mind gives you vision. For you, these two words are exactly the same. Sight and vision. Two words that mean the same thing. I thought that I made this up, I still haven’t checked to see if I accidentally stole someone else’s quote. I gave it to the the teacher on for a project where we cane up a slogan or affirmation or something. I remember her asking if I came up with it. You’ve gotten random compliments from people before on the things you have written. Your English professor read your piece out loud in front of the class. That one guy who puked on your floor was obsessed with you. Your psychology professor complimented your essay when everything else you gave him was average (he didn’t say that last part). These were all significant moments that you let just slide by. They buzzed right out of your mind, onto the next thing. On the social day of XOXO you went to as many as you could. No one else you talked to did the same things. They hung out and got used to each other and learned information about each other. They met new people and looked at there faces and eyes and touched hands. Are you broken or are you wrong? Are you neither? You are neither, don’t let the dramatic sentiment get the better of you. You are the finalities in thought you have while your high. Your thoughts are fragile and listless. They try really hard but they aren’t right all the time. Constantly assuming you are wrong isn’t the perfect solution. Is doing something a different way still making the same decision? Two different paths are still paths. Do the little things that people do matter? Your mind wants to say yes but you also know that’s wrong. Little things do matter. Your touches, your caresses, your smiles and hugs and notes and drunken backslapping, they are important, every bit is important. All of this is temporary and forever.
